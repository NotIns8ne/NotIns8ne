## 🌈 About Me
Hello, wonderful people! My name is **Christian Hatton**, and I'm a self-taught programmer with 16 years of experience. I started with a DevRy college course at age 10, and I have been having fun ever since. I post on twitter daily and I write informational articles on the platform medium. I am dedicated to contributing to open source projects and stack overflow as much as possible. Although, my stack overflow is fairly new. I created the account on November 25th, 2024.

## 💻 My Skills
I am proficient in several things:
- **Python**: Specializing in automation scripts and data analysis tasks. I offer custom Python scripts for various needs.
- **JavaScript**: My go-to language for web development, particularly with frameworks like Node.js and next.js.
- **Node.js**: I created the **League of Legends Toolbelt**, an Alexa skill providing game-related information using voice commands. 🎮 it is outdated because I created it 9 years ago, but unfortunately, we lost the logins to the account, so we can't edit the skill.
- **Java & Kotlin**: Experienced in Java development with a focus on creating things for the game Old School RuneScape.
- **Writing**: I write professional articles that are catered to keeping users reading.
- **Social Media**: I am very experienced in running professional social media accounts.
- **Organization**: I am good at organizing events (such as to represent your business or product).
- **Graphic Design**: I have some college experience in graphic design as this was going to be my major. I can't create you a fresh painting, but I am very good at editing what you already have.
