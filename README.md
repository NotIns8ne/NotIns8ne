## 🌈 About Me
Hello, wonderful people! My name is **Not Insane** (a username that reflects my determination to stay positive), and I'm a self-taught programmer currently navigating a challenging chapter in my life.

### 🏞️ My Story
A few months ago, I faced a situation I didn’t deserve. I was wrongfully arrested for a hit-and-run incident I didn’t commit, which led to **six months in jail**. During that time, I lost all my documents and everything I owned. Since then, I’ve been **homeless for two weeks**, but I’m currently staying in a safe place that offers **food, showers, and beds**.

I’m sharing my story not just to seek help but to showcase my resilience and determination to get back on my feet. I’m actively working to get my documents sorted so I can secure a job and continue my journey as a programmer.

## 💻 My Skills
I'm proficient in several programming languages and frameworks:
- **Python**: Used for various automation scripts and data analysis tasks.
- **JavaScript**: My go-to language for web development, particularly with frameworks like Node.js.
- **Node.js**: I utilized this for creating server-side applications, including my proudest achievement, the **League of Legends Toolbelt**. This was an Alexa skill written in Node.js that provided users with game-related information and tips using voice commands, showcasing my ability to integrate voice technology with gaming. 🎮
- **Java & Kotlin**: I have experience with mobile app development, focusing on building Android applications.

## 📝 My Resume
I may not have a formal degree, but I'm a high achiever with a **4.0 GPA** from my time at the Los Angeles Film School, where I studied graphic design for nine months. Unfortunately, I had to drop out due to my circumstances. I'm also working on rebuilding my credit, which currently sits at **523**.

I’m a giver by nature, and I’ve always strived for excellence. I got a bit unlucky, but I’m determined to turn things around.

```markdown
## 📦 Plugin Hub
I plan to create a **plugin hub** that will manage all my projects and plugins efficiently. This hub will serve as a central location for my various tools and applications, making it easy for users to find and utilize them. Stay tuned for updates on this feature!

## 📱 Future Development
Currently, the program is tailored for mobile use, but I plan to upscale it for laptops, iPads, and other devices as I get access to them. The adaptability will ensure that the tools I create are accessible to a wider audience.

### 🚀 Future Features
- **Web and Desktop Compatibility**: Once I have access to a laptop, I will enhance the program to support web and desktop applications.
- **Donation Capabilities**: I plan to integrate donation options directly into the application interface for ease of use.
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: I will create issues and TODOs in the repository for potential collaborators to help with various features and improvements.
