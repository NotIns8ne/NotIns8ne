## 🌈 About Me
Hello, wonderful people! My name is **Not Insane**, and I'm a self-taught programmer navigating a challenging chapter in my life. I create Python scripts and write articles to help others while also seeking support to get back on my feet.

### 🏞️ My Story
A few months ago, I faced a situation I didn’t deserve. I was wrongfully arrested for a hit-and-run incident I didn’t commit, which led to **six months in jail**. During that time, I lost all my documents and everything I owned. Since then, I’ve been **homeless for two weeks**, but I’m currently staying in a safe place that offers **food, showers, and beds**.

I’m sharing my story not just to seek help but to showcase my resilience and determination to rebuild my life. I’m actively working to get my documents sorted so I can secure a job and continue my journey as a programmer.
