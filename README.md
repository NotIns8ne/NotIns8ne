## üéì Current Work/Life:

I am currently jobless because I'm homeless and I'm waiting on my documents to arrive so I can get a job, so I'm building [Ins8ne N8tion](https://discord.gg/TXjwEXzGGv), researching productivity and its uses within technology internally and externally, and posting to my social media accounts with content relevant to everything you will read on this page.

## üíª My Skills
I am proficient in several things:
- **Python**: Specializing in automation scripts and data analysis tasks. I offer custom Python scripts for various needs.
- **JavaScript**: My go-to language for web development, particularly with frameworks like Node.js and next.js.
- **Node.js**: I created the **League of Legends Toolbelt**, an Alexa skill providing game-related information using voice commands. üéÆ it is outdated because I created it 9 years ago, but unfortunately, we lost the logins to the account, so we can't edit the skill.
- **Java & Kotlin**: Experienced in Java development with a focus on creating things for the game Old School RuneScape.
- **Writing**: I write professional articles that are catered to keeping users reading.
- **Social Media**: I am very experienced in running professional social media accounts.
- **Organization**: I am good at organizing events (such as to represent your business or product).
- **Graphic Design**: I have some college experience in graphic design as this was going to be my major. I can't create you a fresh painting, but I am very good at editing what you already have.
- **Business and Brand Optimization**: I can redesign and restructure your entire company from the ground up and optimize it for the future.

When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy playing **Old School RuneScape**. It's a great way for me to unwind and connect with friends. I'm really interested in runelite plugin creating as well, so you'll see more of that in the future.

## üìù My Resume
I may not have a formal degree, but I'm a high achiever with a **4.0 GPA** from my time at the Los Angeles Film School in 2021, where I studied graphic design for nine months. I had to dropped out because it was too easy and I got bored. I've worked at companies where I had a technologically responsible job a several times. The first time was for a clothing company "Knitted Belle" where I worked on emails, domains, websites, and created designs for other companies' businesses. My mom is the owner. She is a women's business coach. The second time I worked a tech job was when I worked for "Platinum Property Management" in Wisconsin Rapids. I managed the website, redid all of their graphic design work, did customer support on the phone, went to events, and remodeled properties! And, the THIRD time I had a tech job was when I worked for myself doing graphic design! I built the business Vivid Design Co from the ground up in 2021 for about a year. I considered it a startup failure because I only made $800 in a couple months and I found it hard to find customers who needed logos done there are so many sites you can go to and do it yourself for cheap. I did do some cool projects for [Central Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra]() and I got to see my designs plastered all over their events! And, ... NOW, I'm working on ins8ne N8tion! It is basically the I/O hub for the things I create as a digital creator ;)
