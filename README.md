## 🌈 About Me
Hello, wonderful people! My name is **Christian Hatton**, and I'm a self-taught programmer, entrepreneur, and financialist with dreams of one day retiring early.

I write articles on medium and make posts on social medias daily.

I am constantly looking for something to do.

I currently don't have a job because I'm homeless and I'm waiting on my documents to get a job, so I'm building Ins8ne N8tion, researching, and posting to the social media accounts.

## 💻 My Skills
I am proficient in several things:
- **Python**: Specializing in automation scripts and data analysis tasks. I offer custom Python scripts for various needs.
- **JavaScript**: My go-to language for web development, particularly with frameworks like Node.js and next.js.
- **Node.js**: I created the **League of Legends Toolbelt**, an Alexa skill providing game-related information using voice commands. 🎮 it is outdated because I created it 9 years ago, but unfortunately, we lost the logins to the account, so we can't edit the skill.
- **Java & Kotlin**: Experienced in Java development with a focus on creating things for the game Old School RuneScape.
- **Writing**: I write professional articles that are catered to keeping users reading.
- **Social Media**: I am very experienced in running professional social media accounts.
- **Organization**: I am good at organizing events (such as to represent your business or product).
- **Graphic Design**: I have some college experience in graphic design as this was going to be my major. I can't create you a fresh painting, but I am very good at editing what you already have.

## 🎮 Hobbies
When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing **Old School RuneScape**. It's a great way for me to unwind and connect with friends. Gaming keeps my spirits up during tough times! I'm really interested in runelite plugin creating as well, so you'll see more of that in the future.

## 📝 My Resume
I may not have a formal degree, but I'm a high achiever with a **4.0 GPA** from my time at the Los Angeles Film School, where I studied graphic design for nine months. I had to drop out due to my circumstances, but I’m committed to rebuilding my life. I've worked at companies where I had a tech job. The first one was a clothing company where I worked on emails, domains, websites, and created designs for other companies' businesses. The second one was working for a property management as a tech guy and a support agent. Both were super fun. I love this industry.
